From time to time, ChilliClove may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
ChilliClove also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="http://www.chilliclove.com">http://www.chilliclove.com</a> blog posts.
